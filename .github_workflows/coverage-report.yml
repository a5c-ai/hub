name: Coverage Report (proposed fix)

# NOTE: This is a proposed replacement for .github/workflows/coverage-report.yml
# Reason: Recent runs on `main` failed because the self-hosted runner label
# `hub-dev-runners` was unavailable for ~23 hours and the job was cancelled.
# We switch to `ubuntu-latest` to ensure coverage runs on hosted runners.
# A maintainer can copy this file to .github/workflows/ if approved.
