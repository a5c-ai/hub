Started analysis of failed workflow run 17155438322.

Plan:
- Investigate Terraform Apply failure in Infrastructure Deployment.
- Root cause appears to be invalid AutoscalingRunnerSet patch due to missing volumeClaimTemplate.spec.
- Implement fix in terraform/modules/github_runner to always provide valid PVC spec in kubernetes containerMode to satisfy CRD validation.
- Verify Terraform validates locally.
- Open PR linking to failing run.

Updates:
- Implemented change in terraform/modules/github_runner/main.tf to always set containerMode.kubernetes.kubernetesMode.workVolumeClaim.spec = local.volume_spec.
- Opened PR #737 with details and linked failing run.
- Posted analysis and results as a commit comment on 7fed883e.
